      <h2>General Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project was initiated to address a major operational challenge: the time-consuming manual review of thousands of PDF-based inspection reports across the rail network. I developed and implemented an automated data digitization pipeline that transformed static inspection files into structured, searchable data significantly improving how information was accessed, analyzed, and used for decision-making.       <h2>Play now</h2>

      <h2>Software</h2>
      <p>
        I will briefly talk about the technical side of this project here. I used the ADT (Android Developer Tools) plug-in for Eclipse and implemented my game in Java with some formatting in XML. I also used a nice cross-platform game framework called LibGDX. I learned a lot of important game development principles such as implementing the main game loop, game states, external API integration and maintaining a steady 30 FPS. I also learned about unique 2D game techniques such as parallax scrolling to create background/3D depth. Lastly and probably the most important thing that I learned was how to ensure that your app can run smoothly on all devices of all screen sizes, network speeds and processor powers.
