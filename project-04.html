      <h2>General Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This website is the result of a personal project I began during the COVID-19 shutdown to strengthen my software engineering skills thanks in large part to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRemMgGfbKg&list=PLBf-QcbaigsKwq3k2YEBQS17xUwfOA3O3" target="_blank">Leon Noel Free Software Engineering Bootcamp</a>. Recognizing the growing importance of technology, I aimed to pair strong software skills with my civil engineering background to increase my value in the industry. I designed the site from the ground up with a fully responsive, intuitive, and engaging UI/UX, and optimized its performance using Google PageSpeed Insights to ensure fast load times and accessible content.      <h2>Software</h2>
      <p>
        I built this website using the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including jQuery) and Git/Github for version control.    </div>
